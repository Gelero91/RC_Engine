RC_Engine
RayCast Engine by Gwendal LR

This project draws inspiration from the original concept and tutorial created by Lode Vandevenne, with code contributions from *** (apologies, I'm still searching for the specific individual).

I am currently developing a game engine that employs 2D logic to simulate a pseudo 3D environment. The primary objective is to implement procedural world generation. In light of recent advancements in artificial intelligence, I have entertained the idea of incorporating NPC interactions into the engine, although it remains a mere fantasy at this stage.

Tasks at hand:

Integrate textured ground and ceiling rendering.
Introduce the illusion of double or triple-height walls to create a false sense of depth.
The simplicity and clarity of the engine make it an ideal framework for study purposes.

The textures and sprites used in this project are sourced from "RPG MAKER VX".
