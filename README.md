# RC_Engine

RayCast Engine,
By Gwendal LR

Original concept by Lode Vandevenne, 
Code by *** (sorry, I'm still looking for you).

This engine is not originaly mine. 
It's clean and easy to understand, which makes it the perfect wireframe for study.

The textures and sprites comes from "RPG MAKER VX".
